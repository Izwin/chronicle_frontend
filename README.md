**Chronicle** is a modern application developed using Flutter. This open-source project is created for educational purposes, demonstrating how to build applications with Flutter, including routing, network communication, authentication, and state management.

> **Note**: Firebase has been removed from this project to enhance security and privacy. The project now does not rely on Firebase for backend services.

This application utilizes the [Chronicle Backend](https://github.com/Izwin/chronicle_backend) for its backend services.
